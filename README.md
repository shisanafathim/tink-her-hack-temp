# SafeZone 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Evolve

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Name] - [College]
- Member 2: [Name] - [College]

### Hosted Project Link
[Backend (Render)](https://safezone-backend.onrender.com)
[Frontend (Vercel)](https://safezone-frontend.vercel.app)

### Project Description
SafeZone is a lightweight safety application designed to provide immediate SOS alerts. With a single tap, it fetches your live location, notifies emergency contacts via SMS and WhatsApp, and provides shortcuts to nearby safe spots like police stations and hospitals.

### The Problem statement
Personal safety is a major concern, especially when alone or in unfamiliar areas. Traditional methods of seeking help (making a call) can be slow or impossible in high-stress situations.

### The Solution
SafeZone simplifies emergency signaling by automating location sharing and multi-channel alerting (SMS, WhatsApp, Manual Fallback) through a simple, high-visibility interface.
